We're excited to announce that Tashi Network, the real-time, global mesh network that empowers robotic orchestration and AI agent coordination, has officially joined Hashgraph Online DAO as our newest DAO member.

> "Tashi Network is a real-time, global mesh network that empowers robotics communication, AI agent coordination, multiplayer gaming and IoT interactions. Tashi mesh eliminates dependency on central servers, allowing almost instantaneous sync between machines." - Ken Anderson, CTO, Tashi Network

Tashi's localized mesh technology eliminates dependency on central servers, allowing real-time sync between machines. This partnership brings together Hashgraph Online's on-chain infrastructure with Tashi's decentralized coordination layer.

## Membership Update

Following a majority DAO vote utilizing HCS-8 on Hashgraph.vote, Tashi replaces Launchbadge. Launchbadge was led by Ken Anderson. Ken now serves as CTO at Tashi, so the seat aligns with where he and the team are building. His background includes early Hedera leadership as a founding employee and Chief Developer Advocate.

## What Tashi Is

Tashi builds a real‑time mesh for machine‑to‑machine coordination. It targets robotics, AI agents, multiplayer gaming, and IoT. The goal is to remove single points of failure and enable local agreement on state and actions without central servers.

Two products matter to builders right now:

**FoxMQ.** A decentralized MQTT message broker that uses the Tashi Consensus Engine. It focuses on fair ordering, high availability, and clustered operation, and it supports MQTT v5 with TLS and QoS 0–2. (docs.tashi.network)

**Alphanet DePIN.** A public test phase for a community‑run node network with Solana sign‑in. Token is not live yet. (depin.tashi.network)

Tashi successfully closed an oversubscribed funding round of $2 million. The round was led by Blockchain Founders Fund (BFF), with Exponential Science Capital (ESC) co-leading the investment. The round also included top-tier venture firms, including Taisu Ventures and MN Capital (ranked the #1 Dutch Web3 fund in 2024), and a high-profile roster of industry angels, including Gabby Dizon (Co-founder of Yield Guild Games) and Wei Zhou (CEO of Coins.ph; former CFO of Binance).

## How Tashi Fits Hashgraph Online

Hashgraph Online is a standards‑first consortium that defines how agents register, identify themselves, publish profiles, and hold verifiable conversations on Hedera. The core building blocks are HCS‑2 registries, HCS‑10 conversation, HCS‑11 profiles, and HCS‑14 universal agent IDs.

**Identity and discovery.** Agents and devices in Tashi meshes can be registered in HCS‑2 and assigned UAIDs through HCS‑14. That gives every participant a stable, portable identifier that works across protocols, including A2A, REST, and HCS‑10.

**Verifiable conversations and anchoring.** When actions need a proof trail, messages flow through HCS‑10. Teams can keep low‑latency coordination on Tashi, then anchor checkpoints or summaries on HCS for provenance and audit. HCS‑11 holds agent facts and keeps them available even if DNS or hosting goes down.

**Registry Broker.** Your Registry Broker turns the standards stack into a discovery network. It indexes agents across networks and routes chats to the right protocol. Tashi‑registered agents can show up alongside A2A and OpenConvAI agents in one API.

**Developer surface.** Builders keep using the Standards SDK, which implements HCS proposals and provides reference code for A2A and HCS‑10 agents. Tashi's FoxMQ handles local MQTT coordination where latency is critical. The Standards SDK and broker handle identity, routing, and proofs.

## What Changes for Members

**Representation.** Tashi now holds the seat previously occupied by Launchbadge.

**Working groups.** Exploration of how Tashi's FoxMQ and DePin can fit into the wider decentralized agentic internet being built by Hashgraph Online.

## Why This Is a Good Fit

Hashgraph Online gives agents identity, audited conversations, and a discovery layer. Tashi gives them fast local coordination without central servers. The combination keeps proofs global and coordination local. It is a clean division of labor that matches real production needs.

## Gratitude to Launchbadge

Thank you to Launchbadge for long‑standing contributions to the ecosystem. This transition preserves continuity through Ken's leadership and directs that experience toward edge coordination, which many members now need.

## About Tashi Network

Tashi is a real‑time, global mesh network for robotics communication, AI agent coordination, multiplayer gaming, and IoT. It removes dependency on central servers and enables near‑instant device sync. Tashi reports a community network with more than 50,000 nodes and a Solana‑based token launch planned.

## About Hashgraph Online

Hashgraph Online DAO is a consortium building an on‑chain internet with Hedera. The standards stack covers HCS‑2 registries, HCS‑10 conversation, HCS‑11 profiles, and HCS‑14 universal agent IDs. The Registry Broker indexes agents across networks and routes communication through a unified API. The Standards SDK provides reference implementations for builders.

Welcome to the DAO, Tashi Network.
