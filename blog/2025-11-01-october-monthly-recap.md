October was a builder's month: we shipped a major piece of infrastructure, welcomed a powerful new collaborator into our DAO, cheered on hackers across Africa, and prepared the next round of HCS drafts. Here's the rundown, with links for anyone who wants to go deeper.

## ✅ Launch: Hashgraph Online Registry Broker is live

The Universal Agentic Registry is now open. In short: one API to discover, evaluate, and integrate AI agents and MCP servers across multiple networks (including Virtuals, A2A, ERC‑8004, x402 Baazar, OpenConvAI, and more). It unifies discovery and brings trust signals into a single interface so you can build without chasing formats or duplicating submissions.

### Why it matters (from day one):

**Agentic matchmaking & unified registry:** find the right agent/server across networks and see HCS‑backed quality signals in one place.

**Developer‑ready:** RESTful API + TypeScript SDK, with endpoints for search, UAID lookups, registration, and even unified chat.

**"Register once, reach many":** publish your agent once and increase surface area across the networks we index.

A few live stats displayed on the site today: 28M+ HCS transactions, 1,000+ agents & servers indexed, and 300K+ daily CDN requests powering on‑chain data access. (We'll keep improving from here.)

### Try it:

- [Explore the Registry Broker](https://hol.org/registry) and browse agents
- [Register your agent](https://hol.org/registry) and surface verifiable trust signals
- Dive into the API docs when you're ready to wire it in

## 🤝 Ecosystem: Tashi will be joining the Hashgraph Online DAO

We're excited to share that Tashi will be joining the Hashgraph Online DAO. Tashi describes itself as a fully decentralized, low‑latency coordination layer for real‑time machines—a foundation aimed at shifting workloads to the edge. Their materials highlight use cases like moving gaming infrastructure from cloud to edge (eliminating the need for central servers), enabling on‑device AI inference, and supporting IoT via a decentralized MQTT approach (FoxMQ).

You can browse the current roster in our [Members directory](https://hol.org/members) (10 organizations today, spanning wallets, infra, DeFi, storage, and more). Keep an eye there and on the blog as Tashi comes aboard.

**Note:** We'll publish a dedicated blog post soon with more about why Tashi is joining, the collaboration scope, and what this unlocks for builders.

## 🏁 Community: Hedera Africa Hackathon wrapped up October 31

Final submissions closed October 31, and we're grateful to have sponsored the AI track. The energy and creativity from teams across Africa was incredible—we're excited to see the projects that came out of this event. You can view the submissions and results on DoraHacks: [Hedera Africa Hackathon](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/hederahackafrica/detail).

## 📐 Standards: HCS‑15, HCS‑16 & HCS‑17 (coming soon)

We're preparing the next set of HCS drafts. We'll keep it intentionally brief here and share deep dives once things stabilize:

### HCS‑15: Petals - Profile Accounts (Draft)

A pattern for creating multiple "petal" instances under a single key—useful for isolating profiles and holdings while coordinating from a base account.

### HCS‑16: Floras - AppNet Accounts (Draft)

Multi‑signature coordination accounts ("Floras") for decentralized AppNets: a threshold‑key multisig composed of HCS‑15 Petal members, with three mandatory HCS topics (communication, transaction, state) and an HCS‑11 profile for standardized metadata—enabling shared state and coordinated actions.

### HCS‑17: State Hash Calculation (Draft)

A deterministic, verifiable way to compute a single state hash for accounts, with integration points for multi‑party formations (e.g., Flora under HCS‑16).

If you're building against the registry already, these specs are aimed at making identity and state easier to verify across agents and formations—we'll publish migration notes and examples as soon as they land.

## Thanks for building with us

Whether you're registering an agent, hacking on Hedera, or exploring edge‑native architectures like Tashi's, we're thrilled to be building alongside you. See you in November's recap—plus a dedicated post on Tashi's DAO membership.
