# Hedera x AI Hackathon Winners

Celebrating the Builders Pushing Decentralized AI Forward

Over several high-energy weeks, hundreds of developers, designers, and tinkerers joined the Hedera x AI Hackathon to test what happens when artificial intelligence lives on a fast, low-fee public network. Around-the-clock chats, impromptu code reviews, and late-night commits produced a wave of prototypes that stretched Hedera's newest AI tooling in directions no one fully predicted. On Demo Day the judges faced a crowded field and ultimately honored six standout teams, two from each of the event's three tracks.

## Agent Kit / Message Carrier Protocol Track

### First Place: Franky
Many of us have a retired laptop or phone gathering dust. Franky turns that forgotten hardware into an edge node for AI. A trimmed 3-billion-parameter model runs entirely on the device; a quick QR scan registers the machine on-chain, and Lit Protocol keeps secrets encrypted. From there, developers can deploy permissionless agents without renting cloud servers. Franky blends sustainability with decentralization while lowering costs for anyone who needs local compute.

### Second Place: TalentAI
TalentAI rethinks hiring by focusing on verifiable skills instead of résumés. Candidates complete live AI assessments that grade coding ability, problem-solving, and communication. Scores become soul-bound tokens on Hedera, turning claims like "I know React" into credentials a company can trust. Employers send AI agents to scan the talent pool and stake tokens for interview slots, while applicants earn rewards for participating. Thousands of developers have already opted in, pointing to a fairer, more transparent hiring pipeline.

## HCS-10 Open ConvAI Track

### First Place: Unthink AI
In places where information is filtered or lost, Unthink AI offers a censorship-resistant knowledge bot. Every question, answer, and model update writes to Hedera using the HCS-10 standard, giving anyone a public audit trail. The logic lives in lean WASM modules, so communities can spin up mirrors if firewalls block the front-end. By design, reliable information remains reachable even under heavy pressure.

### Second Place: Novix
Research advances fastest when experts collaborate. Novix gives builders a way to chain multiple AI agents into a single workflow: one agent reviews literature, another crunches data, a third drafts findings. Hedera records each step in fair order, making results reproducible and authorship crystal-clear. Early demos showed agents coordinating on protein-folding predictions and publishing the combined output on-chain for peer review.

## Eliza OS Track

### First Place: HederaPayBot
Crypto payments should feel as easy as sending a text. HederaPayBot brings that vision to Telegram and Twitter. A user types "/pay @alice 25 HBAR," confirms the prompt, and the bot moves the tokens without any wallet address or browser extension. Embedded plugins handle wallets and logins behind the scenes, so casual users can transfer assets in seconds.

### Second Place: Contracts Auditor
Writing a smart contract is only half the battle; shipping it safely matters just as much. Contracts Auditor adds automated security checks to a developer's workflow. Upload Solidity code, get an instant risk score, and publish that score to a Hedera topic. The service follows open standards, so dashboards and pull-request checks can surface results anywhere. Micro-payments through HIP-991 keep scans affordable and continuous.

## Why These Projects Matter

Franky breathes new life into dusty hardware, TalentAI makes hiring more equitable, Unthink AI protects open knowledge, Novix fosters collaborative science, HederaPayBot shrinks the learning curve for crypto, and Contracts Auditor raises the bar for on-chain security. Each project tackles a practical problem using open code and public infrastructure instead of closed platforms.

Congratulations to every participant who refactored code at 3 a.m., rewrote documentation yet again, or rehearsed a demo until the video call started. Your work points toward an internet where intelligent agents discover one another, exchange value, and cooperate without a central gatekeeper. The Hedera x AI Hackathon drew the first map; the journey is already under way.
