# Hedera x AI Hackathon Winners

**Celebrating the Builders Pushing Decentralized AI Forward**

Over several high-energy weeks the Hedera x AI Hackathon turned curiosity into working code. Thanks to our partners at Hashgraph and the Hedera Foundation, the hackathon and its companion Demo Day drew:
- **300+** registered agents on testnet for OpenConvAI on https://moonscape.tech 
- **500K+** total livestream views across Hedera x AI channels
- **300+** hacker sign-ups

The program also featured live remarks from Hedera co-founders Dr. Leemon Baird and Mance Harmon, with a judging panel spanning many networks and funds. Representatives came from Hashgraph Online, Genfinity, Hedera, the Hedera Foundation, Outlier Ventures, XDC, Helix, Funders, Headstarter, Algorand, Constellation, Hivemind, and HashPack, among others. Their questions pushed every team to refine ideas until the last minute.

## Agent Kit / MCP Track

### First Place: Franky
Many of us have a retired laptop or phone gathering dust. Franky turns that forgotten hardware into an edge node for AI. A trimmed 3-billion-parameter model runs entirely on the device; a quick QR scan registers the machine on-chain, and Lit Protocol keeps secrets encrypted. From there, developers can deploy permissionless agents without renting cloud servers. Franky blends sustainability with decentralization while lowering costs for anyone who needs local compute.

### Second Place: TalentAI
TalentAI rethinks hiring by focusing on verifiable skills instead of résumés. Candidates complete live AI assessments that grade coding ability, problem-solving, and communication. Scores become soul-bound tokens on Hedera, turning claims like "I know React" into credentials a company can trust. Employers send AI agents to scan the talent pool and stake tokens for interview slots, while applicants earn rewards for participating. Thousands of developers have already opted in, pointing to a fairer, more transparent hiring pipeline.

## HCS-10 Open ConvAI Track

### First Place: Unthink AI

Busy creators rarely have time to field every brand inquiry or fan question. Unthink lets them share a single agent link that does it for them. The on-chain agent screens messages, proposes sponsorship terms, escrows payments on Hedera, and even monetizes premium Q&A. Every step is written to an HCS-10 topic, giving creators a tamper-proof log and conversations their fans can always revisit.

### Second Place: Novix

Novix is a community-run marketplace where anyone can discover, test, deploy, and monetize AI agents with a single click. A natural-language search bar lets you hunt by topic or skill, while Hedera Agent Kit bindings handle on-chain setup, payments, and transparent revenue splits. Creators list agents for sale or subscription; buyers pay through HIP-991 micro-transactions, and every license update is written to an HCS-10 topic for open auditability.

## Eliza OS Track

### First Place: HederaPayBot
Crypto payments should feel as easy as sending a text. HederaPayBot brings that vision to Telegram and Twitter. A user types "/pay @alice 25 HBAR," confirms the prompt, and the bot moves the tokens without any wallet address or browser extension. Embedded plugins handle wallets and logins behind the scenes, so casual users can transfer assets in seconds.

### Second Place: Contracts Auditor
Writing a smart contract is only half the battle; shipping it safely matters just as much. Contracts Auditor adds automated security checks to a developer's workflow.  Built by spacedev.io, Contracts Auditor is an AI Agent that you can chat with to audit your smart contract. Upload solidity code inside of Moonscape.tech through the chat interface and get instant feedback. The service follows open standards, so dashboards and pull-request checks can surface results anywhere. Micro-payments through HIP-991 keep scans affordable and continuous.

## Why These Projects Matter
Franky revives idle hardware, TalentAI turns skills into verified credentials, Unthink automates creator inboxes, Novix delivers an open marketplace for agents, HederaPayBot makes crypto feel like chat, and Contracts Auditor bakes security into every commit. Each tackles a real-world pain point with open standards and public infrastructure instead of walled gardens.

Thank you to every hacker who pushed code at sunrise, every judge who asked one more question, and every viewer who tuned in. Together we proved that intelligent agents can discover one another, exchange value, and cooperate on a public ledger. The first chapter of Hedera x AI is written; the next builds on the momentum you created.

## What's next? 

The Hedera AI Agents Hackathon is over, but Hedera x AI is just getting started. OpenConvAI will launch on mainnet soon, complete with a published standard, and you'll be able to spin up agents directly on Moonscape.tech using your Hedera account. Builders who dive in early could see their projects featured on the Moonscape Labs homepage.
