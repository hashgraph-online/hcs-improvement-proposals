# Neuron Joins Hashgraph Online DAO: Powering a New Era of AI and Machine Commerce

Big news in the world of Web3: Neuron is now officially part of the Hashgraph Online DAO. If you're into AI agents, decentralized infrastructure, or just love seeing futuristic tech come to life, this partnership is worth celebrating.

> *"Neuron is delighted to be invited to join the HashgraphOnline DAO, a group of builders on Hedera. By joining the DAO, Neuron hopes to foster strong relationships with other builders in the ecosystem, as well as contribute to standards that enable greater interoperability. We're excited to see how this membership can contribute to our long-term vision."* - James Dunthorne, CEO & Co-Founder of Neuron

Let's break down why this matters, what Neuron is building, and how Hashgraph Online DAO is laying the foundation for a truly autonomous internet.

## What is Neuron?

[Neuron](https://www.neuron.world/) is all about machine-to-machine commerce. Think of it like this: what if drones, AI agents, sensors, and other devices could discover each other, connect directly, and pay for services , all without humans in the loop? That's exactly what Neuron enables.

Using a decentralized network of lightweight nodes, Neuron lets machines:
- **Find each other**
- **Talk directly**
- **Buy and sell data or services**
- **Verify transactions securely on-chain**

It's fast, secure, and doesn't rely on any central server. Even cooler , these nodes can run anywhere: cloud servers, laptops, even a Raspberry Pi.

One of Neuron's big wins? Real-world deployments. They've already worked with cities like Milton Keynes in the UK to help drones safely deliver medical supplies and inspect infrastructure.

### How is Neuron Different?

- **Low latency**: Up to 50x faster than traditional systems
- **Truly decentralized**: No central bottlenecks or failure points
- **Real-world ready**: Already trusted by regulators and airports
- **$NRN Token**: Used to power transactions and governance across the Neuron network

Neuron gives AI agents and devices the ability to trade services, like weather data or sensor access, in real time, all on the blockchain.

## What is Hashgraph Online DAO?

Hashgraph Online DAO is a consortium of builders creating an internet that lives entirely on-chain using Hedera's Consensus Service (HCS). No servers. No gatekeepers. Just decentralized infrastructure that's fast, secure, and scalable.

The DAO includes:
- Storage and CDN platforms
- Crypto wallets
- DeFi apps
- Marketplaces
- Governance tools

Each member helps build open standards (called HCS standards) so everything works together seamlessly.

### Our Mission

- **Build the future of a decentralized internet**
- **Publish open tools and standards for developers**
- **Enable autonomous apps, bots, and infrastructure**

So far, the DAO has pushed over 28 million transactions and released 15+ standards for things like storage, discovery, and even AI agent communication.

## Expertise Neuron Brings to the DAO

Neuron joins the DAO with deep technical and strategic experience in decentralized intelligence infrastructure. Their contributions are expected to strengthen several key areas within the Hashgraph Online ecosystem:

- **Agent design and modular intelligence architecture**: Neuron's team has pioneered frameworks for building intelligent agents with explainable outputs and verifiable workflows. This aligns closely with Hashgraph Online's investment in open standards like OpenConvAI and modular agent plugins.

- **Real-time infrastructure**: Neuron's live feed system provides low-latency, cross-platform insight delivery,beneficial for builders using Hedera's high-throughput consensus layer who require up-to-the-second data coordination.

- **Cross-ecosystem integrations**: With proven experience in integrating intelligence tools across a wide range of decentralized applications, Neuron can help extend Hashgraph Online's reach to new users, protocols, and use cases.

- **Commitment to open collaboration**: Neuron's public SDKs, plugin templates, and transparent development practices are an asset to the broader mission of building open, composable tooling across Hedera and beyond.

As the Hashgraph Online DAO continues to evolve, Neuron's expertise will support initiatives focused on autonomous agent development, community intelligence sharing, and verifiable coordination systems,all essential to building a more accountable and decentralized future.

**Welcome to the DAO, Neuron.**
