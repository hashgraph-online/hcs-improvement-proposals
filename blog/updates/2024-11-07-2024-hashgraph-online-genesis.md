## Our Mission

Hashgraph Online DAO LLC is a consortium of leading organizations on Hedera. Our mission is to construct a true decentralized internet built with Hedera's robust Consensus Service as the backbone, with a commitment to openness and transparency. We're approaching this through three key strategic pillars:

1. **Creating Standards**
   We've established standards like [HCS-1](https://hashgraphonline.com/docs/standards/hcs-1) and [HCS-20](https://hashgraphonline.com/docs/standards/hcs-20), which have processed millions of transactions. We're continuing to develop new standards to address evolving challenges.

2. **Open Source Development**
   Our open-source tools and applications are designed to facilitate the growth of this new internet infrastructure, ensuring that all participants have access to a transparent and resilient ecosystem.

3. **Building Products and Services**
   We are committed to developing products and services that will enable seamless user experience and accessibility to the decentralized internet, ensuring long-term value and sustainability for our DAO.

> "The DAO's commitment to open-source development not only democratizes access but also fosters a spirit of innovation essential to redefining what's possible with an on-chain internet." - Brandon Davenport, Director of Communications, Hgraph

## Our Story

Hashgraph Online's journey began on January 4th, 2024, with the creation of HCS-20, the Auditable Points Standard on Hedera. Pioneered by Turtlemoon, this groundbreaking specification for minting, transferring, and burning points has contributed to over 18 million transactions on the mainnet.

The success led to further innovation with HCS-1 and HCS-5 on March 5th, 2024, developed by KiloScribe, Turtlemoon, SentX, and HashPack. These standards enabled secure, on-graph storage and "Hashinals," generating over 141,000 NFTs and 7.6 million additional transactions.

From there, we collectively decided to form a legal entity, Hashgraph Online DAO LLC, composed of leading organizations in the Hedera ecosystem, to further develop the ecosystem and create a fully on-chain internet.

We've already proven that HCS is a viable and secure foundation for a decentralized internet, in fact a number of [use cases](/use-cases) found on our website are already live.
