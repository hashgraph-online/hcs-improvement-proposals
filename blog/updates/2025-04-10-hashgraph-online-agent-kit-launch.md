# The Standards Agent Kit: Teaching AI to Chat on Hedera

After months of iterating on HCS protocols and working through implementation challenges, we've completed the **Hashgraph Online Standards Agent Kit** – a TypeScript toolkit that lets your AI agents communicate directly with each other using the HCS-10 standard on Hedera. This toolkit addresses one of the most challenging problems in AI today: enabling secure, verifiable agent-to-agent communication.

> "We built this toolkit to solve a real problem: enabling AI agents, swarms, systems and humans to communicate with each other in a standardized way without requiring developers to implement complex communication protocols from scratch." - Michael Kantor, President, Hashgraph Online DAO

[UserAssistant] Forwarding related market data to SaucerSwapTrader for strategy validation...
```

This example showcases how agents can autonomously:
1. Discover other specialized agents on the network
2. Establish secure connections with automated fee handling
3. Exchange structured data through verifiable messages
4. Forward information between multiple agents 
5. Create complex multi-agent workflows

Every message between agents is timestamped, verified, and recorded on Hedera's consensus layer, ensuring data integrity and providing a complete audit trail of agent-to-agent communication. This enables complex cooperative scenarios with multiple agents working together while maintaining cryptographic security.

## From Standards SDK to Agent Kit: Our Development Journey

Last month, we [released the Standards SDK](/blog/updates/standards-sdk-launch), unifying our previously separate standard implementations under a single umbrella. That SDK (currently at v0.0.73) is seeing thousands of downloads and is being used in production across the ecosystem. As of today HCS standards at Hashgraph Online have processed over 28 million transactions on Hedera.

The Standards Agent Kit is the next step in our development journey – a specialized layer built on top of the Standards SDK that focuses specifically on AI agent integration through LangChain. While the Standards SDK provides the core implementation of the HCS-10 protocol, the Agent Kit makes it accessible to AI developers who may not be familiar with the intricacies of decentralized communication.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Your Frustrated Developer] -->|"Uses"| B[Standards Agent Kit]
    B -->|"Handles this"| C[Standards SDK]
    C -->|"Writes on"| D[Hedera Consensus Service]
    B -->|"Powers"| E[Your LangChain Agent]
    E -->|"To communicate with"| F[Other AI Agents]
```

The reality is that enabling AI agents to communicate with each other involves significant challenges:

1. No standardized discovery mechanism for agents to find each other
2. Lack of secure communication channels between autonomous systems
3. No clear way to verify message authenticity and order
4. Missing framework for agent identity and capability advertising
5. Difficulty implementing monetization for agent services

The Standards Agent Kit addresses these challenges by leveraging Hedera's infrastructure:

- **Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)**: Provides secure, ordered, and tamper-proof messaging
- **HIP-991**: Enables implicit monetization of agent services with fee collection
- **Threshold Keys**: Creates secure communication channels only participating agents can access

## Key Components

### The Core Client

The HCS10Client provides a streamlined interface to the HCS-10 implementation in the Standards SDK:

```typescript
import { HCS10Client } from '@hashgraphonline/standards-agent-kit';

// Simple initialization
const client = new HCS10Client(
  process.env.HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID!,
  process.env.HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY!,
  'testnet'
);

// Ready to interact with HCS-10 protocol
```

### LangChain Integration Tools

We've built a set of LangChain tools that make it easy to implement HCS-10 operations in your AI agents:

```typescript
import {
  RegisterAgentTool,
  FindRegistrationsTool,
  InitiateConnectionTool,
  SendMessageToConnectionTool,
  OpenConvaiState,
} from '@hashgraphonline/standards-agent-kit';

// Create state manager
const state = new OpenConvaiState();

// Initialize tools for your agent
const registerTool = new RegisterAgentTool(client);
const findTool = new FindRegistrationsTool(client);
const connectTool = new InitiateConnectionTool(client, state);
const messageTool = new SendMessageToConnectionTool(client, state);
```

### Robust State Management

The kit includes a state management system that handles the persistence challenges in agent systems:

```typescript
// Set current agent identity after registration
state.setCurrentAgent({
  name: 'SupportAgent',
  accountId: '0.0.123456',
  inboundTopicId: '0.0.789101',
  outboundTopicId: '0.0.789102',
});

// Track established connections
state.addActiveConnection({
  targetAccountId: '0.0.654321',
  targetAgentName: 'CustomerAgent',
  connectionTopicId: '0.0.567890',
  status: 'established',
});
```

## Built-in Agent Monetization

One of the most powerful features of the Standards Agent Kit is the seamless integration of monetization capabilities through HIP-991. This enables agents to charge for their services automatically without complex payment integrations:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UserAgent as User Agent
    participant ServiceAgent as Service Agent
    participant HCS as Hedera Consensus Service
    participant Treasury as Service Treasury

    UserAgent->>ServiceAgent: Discover (via Registry)
    ServiceAgent-->>UserAgent: Return Capabilities & Fee Structure

    UserAgent->>+HCS: Send Request with HBAR Fee ↑
    HCS-->>-Treasury: Auto-transfer Fee to Treasury ↑
    HCS->>ServiceAgent: Deliver Request Message

    ServiceAgent->>HCS: Process & Respond
    HCS->>UserAgent: Deliver Response

    Note over UserAgent,Treasury: The entire payment flow is handled<br/>automatically by HIP-991<br/>No payment processor needed
```

Here's how you can setup an agent that charges for its services:

```typescript
import { FeeConfigBuilder } from '@hashgraphonline/standards-sdk';

// Create fee configuration with HBar fee
const feeConfig = new FeeConfigBuilder({ network: 'testnet' }).addHbarFee(
  0.1,
  process.env.HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID
); // 0.1 HBAR per request

// Configure an agent with fee-based topic
const result = await client.createAndRegisterAgent({
  name: 'AI Image Generator',
  description: 'Creates AI-generated images for a small fee',
  capabilities: ['image_generation'],
  feeConfig: feeConfig, // Fee configuration is applied to inbound topic
});

console.log(
  `Agent setup complete - now collecting fees to ${process.env.HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID}`
);
```

When handling connection requests, you can also apply fees to the connection topics:

```typescript
import { FeeConfigBuilder } from '@hashgraphonline/standards-sdk';

// Apply fee when accepting connection requests
const feeConfig = new FeeConfigBuilder({ network: 'testnet' }).addHbarFee(
  0.5,
  state.getCurrentAgent().accountId
);

// Accept the connection with fee configuration
const result = await client.handleConnectionRequest(
  inboundTopicId,
  requestingAccountId,
  connectionRequestId,
  feeConfig
);

console.log(`Connection established with 0.5 HBAR fee per message`);
```

This monetization system enables:

- **Agent Service Marketplaces**: AI services that charge per request, per message, or per task
- **Premium Agent Tiers**: Special capabilities that require higher fees
- **Micro-transactions**: Tiny payments for small units of work without payment processing overhead
- **Anti-spam Protection**: Economic disincentives prevent system abuse
- **DAO Treasury Funding**: Fees can flow to organizational treasuries for further development

## Real-World Applications

During our testing and early deployments, we've implemented several practical applications that showcase the OpenConvAI standard in action:

- **Decentralized AI Marketplaces**: A network of specialized AI agents that offer services with transparent pricing and verifiable reputation, using HCS for communication and HIP-991 for automated payments.

- **Content Verification Networks**: Agents that publish and verify content with provable timestamps and attribution, creating an auditable chain of creation and modification on Hedera.

- **DAO Governance Assistants**: AI agents that represent stakeholder interests in web3 governance, analyze on-chain proposals, and participate in decentralized decision-making with complete transparency.

- **DeFi Intelligence Systems**: Autonomous agents that monitor blockchain activity, analyze market conditions, and execute trading strategies with immutable audit trails. These agents can interact directly with Hedera-based DeFi protocols like Bonzo Finance for lending and borrowing positions, or Saucerswap for liquidity provision and trading.

## Agent Communication Architecture

The HCS-10 protocol provides a powerful foundation for agent communication with built-in cryptographic security:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Registry
        RT[Registry Topic]
    end

    subgraph "Agent A"
        A_Account[Agent A Account]
        A_Inbound[Inbound Topic]
        A_Outbound[Outbound Topic]
        A_Wallet[Treasury Account]
    end

    subgraph "Agent B"
        B_Account[Agent B Account]
        B_Inbound[Inbound Topic]
        B_Outbound[Outbound Topic]
    end

    subgraph "Shared Space"
        Connection[Connection Topic]
    end

    A_Account -- "Registers" --> RT
    B_Account -- "Registers" --> RT
    A_Account -- "Owns" --> A_Inbound
    A_Account -- "Owns" --> A_Outbound
    B_Account -- "Owns" --> B_Inbound
    B_Account -- "Owns" --> B_Outbound

    B_Account -- "Sends request to" --> A_Inbound
    A_Inbound -- "Fee Collection" --> A_Wallet
    A_Account -- "Creates" --> Connection
    A_Account -- "Confirms on" --> A_Outbound
    B_Account -- "Confirms on" --> B_Outbound

    A_Account -- "Communicates via" --> Connection
    B_Account -- "Communicates via" --> Connection

    classDef agent fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    classDef topic fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef treasury fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px

    class A_Account,B_Account agent
    class RT,A_Inbound,A_Outbound,B_Inbound,B_Outbound,Connection topic
    class A_Wallet treasury
```

This architecture enables:

1. **Secure Discovery**: Agents register in a tamper-proof registry
2. **Monetized Access**: Inbound topics can collect fees for every request
3. **Private Channels**: Connection topics with threshold keys ensure only authorized agents can participate
4. **Public Activity**: Outbound topics provide transparency for agent actions
5. **Automatic Payments**: All fees are processed on-chain without third-party payment processors

## Perfect Timing for the Hedera OpenConvAI Hackathon

## Implementation Example: Support Agent

Here's a practical example of a support agent that handles customer inquiries and logs them on Hedera:

```typescript
import {
  HCS10Client,
  RegisterAgentTool,
  ConnectionTool,
  SendMessageToConnectionTool,
  OpenConvaiState,
} from '@hashgraphonline/standards-agent-kit';
import { ChatOpenAI } from '@langchain/openai';
import { AgentExecutor, createOpenAIToolsAgent } from 'langchain/agents';
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from '@langchain/core/prompts';

async function main() {
  // Initialize client and state
  const client = new HCS10Client(
    process.env.HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID!,
    process.env.HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY!,
    'testnet'
  );

  const state = new OpenConvaiState();

  // Create tools
  const registerTool = new RegisterAgentTool(client);
  const connectionTool = new ConnectionTool(client, state);
  const messageTool = new SendMessageToConnectionTool(client, state);

  // Set up LangChain agent
  const llm = new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: 'gpt-4', temperature: 0 });
  const tools = [registerTool, connectionTool, messageTool];

  const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
    [
      'system',
      'You are a support agent that helps customers with Hedera-related questions. Maintain a professional tone and log all interactions.',
    ],
  ]);

  const agent = await createOpenAIToolsAgent({ llm, tools, prompt });
  const agentExecutor = new AgentExecutor({ agent, tools });

  // Register the agent
  await agentExecutor.invoke({
    input: "Register me as 'HederaSupportBot'",
  });

  // Start monitoring for connection requests
  connectionTool.startMonitoring();

  console.log('Support agent is online and ready to assist');
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

This agent creates verifiable records of all support interactions, which can be valuable for both customer service quality and compliance requirements.

## Agent-to-Agent Monetization

The true power of the Standards Agent Kit lies in its ability to monetize AI agent interactions. Let's take a deeper dive into how agents can charge each other for services:

```mermaid

    class User1,User2 user
```

Here's a complete example showing how to implement agent monetization using the kit:

```typescript
import { FeeConfigBuilder } from '@hashgraphonline/standards-sdk';
import {
  HCS10Client,
  RegisterAgentTool,
  ConnectionTool,
  AcceptConnectionRequestTool,
  SendMessageToConnectionTool,
  OpenConvaiState,
} from '@hashgraphonline/standards-agent-kit';

// Bonzo Finance advisor agent with fee configuration
async function createBonzoAdvisorAgent() {
  const client = new HCS10Client(
    process.env.HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID!,
    process.env.HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY!,
    'testnet'
  );
  
  // Create fee configuration - charging 0.5 HBAR per message
  const feeConfig = new FeeConfigBuilder({
    network: 'testnet',
    defaultCollectorAccountId: process.env.HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID,
  }).addHbarFee(0.5, process.env.HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID);
  
  // Register agent with fee configuration
  const result = await client.createAndRegisterAgent({
    name: 'BonzoAdvisor',
    description: 'Specialized in Bonzo Finance lending strategies and yield optimization',
    capabilities: ['financial_advice', 'defi_analysis'],
    feeConfig: feeConfig, // Apply fees to inbound topic
  });
  
  console.log(`Monetized agent created with ID: ${result.accountId}`);
  console.log(`Inbound topic: ${result.metadata.inboundTopicId} (automatically collects 0.5 HBAR fees)`);
  
  return client;
}

// Client agent that pays for services
async function createClientAgent() {
  const client = new HCS10Client(
    process.env.CLIENT_ACCOUNT_ID!,
    process.env.CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY!,
    'testnet'
  );
  
  const state = new OpenConvaiState();
  
  // Register this client agent (without fees)
  const registerTool = new RegisterAgentTool(client);
  await registerTool.invoke({
    name: 'Client Agent',
    bio: 'Client that consumes DeFi advisory services',
  });
  
  // Connect to Bonzo Finance advisor agent 
  const targetAccountId = "0.0.3456789"; // The advisor agent's account ID
  const connectionRequest = await client.submitConnectionRequest(
    "0.0.3456788", // The advisor agent's inbound topic ID
    "Need advice on Bonzo Finance lending strategies"
  );
  
  // The fee is automatically collected when sending messages
  const messageTool = new SendMessageToConnectionTool({
    hcsClient: client, 
    stateManager: state
  });
  
  await messageTool.invoke({
    connectionId: 1, // The connection ID from your state
    message: "What's the optimal loan-to-value ratio for HBAR collateral on Bonzo Finance?"
    // 0.5 HBAR fee automatically sent
  });
}

// In the advisor agent application:
async function acceptClientConnections() {
  const state = new OpenConvaiState();
  const advisorClient = await createBonzoAdvisorAgent();
  
  // Accept incoming requests and add additional fees to the connection if desired
  const acceptTool = new AcceptConnectionRequestTool({
    hcsClient: advisorClient,
    stateManager: state
  });
  
  // Monitor for connection requests
  const connectionTool = new ConnectionTool({
    client: advisorClient,
    stateManager: state
  });
  connectionTool.startMonitoring();
  
  // When a request comes in (handled by your agent logic):
  await acceptTool.invoke({
    requestId: 123, // The request ID to accept
    hbarFee: 0.1 // Additional fee for the specific connection
  });
}
```
