Welcome to the August edition of the Hashgraph Online Monthly Recap, where we highlight the momentum, milestones, and developments shaping the future of the on-chain internet.

Last month was all about AI, community growth, and major movement across the DAO. 

Let's dive in.

## Neuron Joins the DAO: A Leap Forward for AI and Machine Commerce

One of the most exciting updates this month: **Neuron**, the decentralized intelligence company building real-world-ready agent infrastructure, officially joined the Hashgraph Online DAO.

Neuron enables machine-to-machine commerce. Think drones, AI agents, and IoT devices discovering and transacting with each other autonomously. Their team brings deep expertise in agent design, real-time infrastructure, and cross-ecosystem integrations.

This partnership strengthens our mission to build autonomous, serverless systems on Hedera. Together, we're laying the foundation for agents that can think, act, and coordinate in a decentralized world.

## Hedera Africa Hackathon: AI Track Now Live

We're proud sponsors of the **AI Track** at the 2025 Hedera Africa Hackathon, the largest Hedera hackathon ever.

- **Dates:** August 1 ‚Äì September 30
- **Track Focus:** Building AI-powered apps using Hedera and Hashgraph Online's OpenConvAI standard
- **Required:** On-chain deployment via Hedera Testnet or Mainnet
- **Learn More & Register:** [AI Track Details](/hackathon)

### Tools for Builders

- [Standards SDK](https://hashgraphonline.com/docs/libraries/standards-sdk/) - Access the full suite of HCS Improvement Proposals and OpenConvAI SDK
- [Hedera Agent Kit](https://github.com/hedera-dev/hedera-agent-kit) - AI-powered toolkit with LangChain integration for building intelligent agents
- [Conversational Agent](https://github.com/hashgraph-online/conversational-agent) - Complete conversational AI agent implementing HCS standards
- [Standards AgentKit](https://hashgraphonline.com/docs/libraries/standards-agent-kit/) - Langchain-based toolkit implementing HCS standards
- [Moonscape Portal](https://moonscape.tech) - Live testing environment for AI agents using HCS-10
- [Hiero JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-sdk-js) - Official SDK for building on Hedera with JavaScript/TypeScript
- [Hedera Consensus Service](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/sdks/consensus-service) - Build decentralized applications with verifiable timestamps and ordering

Developers across Africa‚Äî and all over the world‚Äî are already gearing up to build agents, automation systems, and intelligent dApps. If you haven't started yet, now's the time.

## Hedera x AI Spaces Are Back

After a short break, our weekly Thursday X Spaces are back in full force. Join us every Thursday at 12PM EDT as we spotlight builders, support hackathon participants, and dive into the latest around AI and decentralization.

Each Space features:
- Live Q&A and dev support
- Community ideas and proposals
- OpenConvAI news and updates
- Giveaways sponsored by our partners

## HashPack Sponsors Live Giveaway Series

Thanks to our DAO member [HashPack](https://www.hashpack.app/), we've been able to sponsor $100 in $PACK giveaways during our weekly Spaces.

Listeners who tune in and comment during the live session are entered automatically. It's a small but impactful way of giving back to the community that shows up and helps push the space forward.

## Moonscape Points & OpenConvAI Portal Go Live on Mainnet

It's official: **Moonscape Points** and the **OpenConvAI Portal** are now live on Hedera Mainnet.

- **Moonscape Points** (built using HCS-20) let users collect rewards for participation ‚Äî including building, testing agents, and contributing feedback
- **The OpenConvAI Portal** (using HCS-10) allows anyone to discover, test, and interact with conversational agents running entirely on Hedera

Explore the portal at: https://moonscape.tech

## Metrics & Milestones

We believe in building transparently. Here's where we stand as of August 1st:

- **28M+** transactions processed on Hedera
- **15+** standards published for agent development, storage, identity, and more
- **6+** SDKs and plugins available for builders
- **Hackathon participation** from over 40 countries and growing
- **Continued growth** in DAO contributor activity and developer engagement

## What's Coming This Month

Here's a peek at what's ahead for August:

- Registrations will be open and ongoing beginning August 1
- More livestreams with Genfinity to support AI Track developers
- A spotlight on early hackathon submissions
- A deeper dive into OpenConvAI's roadmap beyond the hackathon
