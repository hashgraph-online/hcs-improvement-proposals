Big news in the world of Web3: Neuron is now officially part of the Hashgraph Online DAO. If you're into AI agents, decentralized infrastructure, or just love seeing futuristic tech come to life, this partnership is worth celebrating.

> "Neuron is delighted to be invited to join the HashgraphOnline DAO, a group of builders on Hedera. By joining the DAO, Neuron hopes to foster strong relationships with other builders in the ecosystem, as well as contribute to standards that enable greater interoperability. We're excited to see how this membership can contribute to our long-term vision." - James Dunthorne, CEO & Co-Founder of Neuron

Let's break down why this matters, what Neuron is building, and how Hashgraph Online DAO is laying the foundation for a truly autonomous internet.

## What is Neuron?

Neuron is all about machine-to-machine commerce. Think of it like this: what if drones, AI agents, sensors, and other devices could discover each other, connect directly, and pay for services — all without humans in the loop? That's exactly what Neuron enables.

Using a decentralized network of lightweight nodes, Neuron lets machines:
- Find each other
- Talk directly
- Buy and sell data or services
- Verify transactions securely on-chain

It's fast, secure, and doesn't rely on any central server. Even cooler — these nodes can run anywhere: cloud servers, laptops, even a Raspberry Pi.

One of Neuron's big wins? Real-world deployments. They've already worked with cities like Milton Keynes in the UK to help drones safely deliver medical supplies and inspect infrastructure.

## How is Neuron Different?

- **Low latency**: Up to 50x faster than traditional systems
- **Truly decentralized**: No central bottlenecks or failure points
- **Real-world ready**: Already trusted by regulators and airports
- **$NRN Token (coming soon)**: Used to reward validators for moderating the network, resolving disputes and ensuring user safety

Neuron gives AI agents and devices the ability to trade services, like weather data or sensor access, in real time, all orchestrated on the blockchain and settled using the x402 payment standard.

## What is Hashgraph Online DAO?

We're building the on-chain internet — complete internet infrastructure that lives entirely on Hedera. No servers, no centralized control, just pure decentralized infrastructure powered by HCS.

The DAO includes **Bonzo Finance** (DeFi lending), **Builder Labs** (venture studio), **HashPack** (leading Hedera wallet), **Hashgate** (payment gateway), **Hgraph** (mirror node infrastructure), **LaunchBadge** (software engineering), **KiloScribe** (on-graph file storage), **SentX** (NFT marketplace), **Turtlemoon** (web3 platforms), and now **Neuron** (machine-to-machine commerce).

So far we've published 15+ open standards and processed over 28 million transactions. Our standards enable everything from on-chain file storage to AI agent communication to transparent point systems. We're creating the building blocks for websites without servers, AI agents that discover each other autonomously, and economic systems that run themselves.

The future of the internet is on-chain, and we're building it.

## Expertise Neuron Brings to the DAO

Neuron joins the DAO with deep technical and strategic experience in decentralized intelligence infrastructure. Their contributions are expected to strengthen several key areas within the Hashgraph Online ecosystem:

**Agent design and modular intelligence architecture**: Neuron's team has pioneered frameworks for building intelligent agents with explainable outputs and verifiable workflows. This aligns closely with Hashgraph Online's investment in open standards like OpenConvAI and modular agent plugins.

**Real-time infrastructure**: Neuron's live feed system provides low-latency, cross-platform insight delivery—beneficial for builders using Hedera's high-throughput consensus layer who require up-to-the-second data coordination.

**Cross-ecosystem integrations**: With proven experience in integrating intelligence tools across a wide range of decentralized applications, Neuron can help extend Hashgraph Online's reach to new users, protocols, and use cases.

**Commitment to open collaboration**: Neuron's public SDKs, plugin templates, and transparent development practices are an asset to the broader mission of building open, composable tooling across Hedera and beyond.

As the Hashgraph Online DAO continues to evolve, Neuron's expertise will support initiatives focused on autonomous agent development, community intelligence sharing, and verifiable coordination systems—all essential to building a more accountable and decentralized future.

Welcome to the DAO, Neuron.
