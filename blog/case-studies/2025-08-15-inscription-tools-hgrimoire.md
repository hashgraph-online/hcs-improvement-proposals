[HGrimoire](https://grimterminal.app) is a secure, intuitive platform for navigating the Hedera Hashgraph.

Although not an actual wallet, HGrimoire offers a familiar, user-friendly interface combined with the utility of an explorer. Security and privacy are treated with the utmost care, and its toolset continues to expand. From analytics and historical data to Web3 utilities and builder-focused features, HGrimoire is designed to make exploring and interacting with the Hedera ecosystem easier and fun.

## Content Inscription Tools and Hashinal Viewer: Using the Inscribe Utilities

HGrimoire combines the creation and verification of on-chain content in one place. The Inscribe Utilities from HashgraphOnline make it simple to publish content and structured messages to Hedera’s Consensus Service, following the HCS-1 standard for reliable, permanent storage.

The publicly available inscription API integrates with HGrimoire Viewer to fetch, reconstruct, and display Hashinals directly in the interface. Users can easily view their on-chain assets along with key details. Behind the scenes, HGrimoire uses the Inscription SDK to manage inscription workflows, ensuring smooth and reliable inscription and retrieval within the dapp.

## HGrimoire Viewer

One of HGrimoire’s primary functions is serving as the hub for [Hashinal Grims](https://hashinalgrims.com). Holders can connect and view their Grims within the dapp. The Viewer allows users to browse their Hashinal Grims, including asset details, inscription numbers, provenance, and metadata. It also supports exporting high-quality images and assets.

The HGrimoire Viewer is not limited to Hashinal Grims, any supported Hedera account can be searched to explore NFTs and other Hashinals across collections. Its compact, mobile-friendly design ensures large collections and long histories remain easy to navigate.

The same viewer is utilized for **HashLibrary**, a tool within HGrimoire that acts as a public hub for comic-style content on the Hedera network. Through this platform, users can seamlessly explore, read, and interact with visual narratives, ranging from indie comics and illustrated stories to graphic novel experiments.

## Content Inscription Tools

HGrimoire includes several tools for inscription workflows used by creators, communities, and builders.

**InscribeMaster** is the primary inscription tool, guiding users from file or URL selection through validation, optional metadata entry, and submission to the network. It supports two input methods:

* Small files are encoded and inscribed directly.
* Larger files are handled via a URL flow for smooth publishing of bigger content.

It supports general file inscriptions, single Hashinals, and collection inscriptions where a ZIP file of organized images and JSON metadata is stored as a set. Users can review content, description, and fees before signing. Once submitted, the tool tracks job IDs, checks status until complete, and provides shareable links and downloadable receipts. All of this is powered by the HashgraphOnline's **Inscription SDK** for a consistent inscription process and verifiable results.

**Hashinal Zip Builder** streamlines collection preparation. Creators can drag and drop images, batch-add JSON metadata, and attach secondary files. The builder enforces proper numbering, matches images to metadata, and previews folder structure. When ready, it creates a standards-compliant ZIP containing images, metadata, and any extra files. The set can then be downloaded or sent directly to inscription. This process reduces errors and saves significant time for handling large collections.

## Other Mini-Tools Using the Inscribe Utilities

**Hashinal Links** enables users to create a simple link-in-bio style page and store it permanently on-chain as self-contained HTML. Links can be added, styles customized, and pages previewed before exporting. The static HTML renders exactly as published, and the viewer allows for easy sharing of a verified, permanent page.

**Gallery Inscriber** allows users to create themed gallery pages without leaving the app. With content and theme editors, templates, and live preview, it’s simple to design a complete gallery. The finished HTML can be downloaded or sent to InscribeMaster for inscription, producing a permanent, portable gallery, ideal for collections, showcases, or visual storytelling.

**WinMaster** is built for contests, raffles, and provable random draws. Organizers can define eligible participants, set weighting rules, and run a draw that outputs both a human-readable result and a machine-verifiable record. The result can be inscribed as a compact JSON receipt tied to a Hedera topic message. Participants can view and verify results directly in HGrimoire. When used alongside the Hashinal Viewer, WinMaster provides communities with a single, trusted space to run fair giveaways and maintain permanent proof of results.

## Summary

HGrimoire is a Hedera-based platform that merges exploration, asset viewing, and on-chain publishing into a single interface. With several tools powered by HashgraphOnline’s **Inscribe Utilities**, it supports secure and verifiable storage for files, collections, galleries, and contest results. Key tools like **InscribeMaster**, **Hashinal Zip Builder**, **Hashinal Links**, **Gallery Inscriber**, and **WinMaster** streamline workflows for creators, communities, builders, and enthusiasts.
