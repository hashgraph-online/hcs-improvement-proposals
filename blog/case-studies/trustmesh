# HCS-21 TrustMesh – Decentralized Trust Signaling with Scend

![TrustMesh Logo](./scendcash_logo.jpg)

## TrustMesh: Compliance-Grade Trust Infrastructure

TrustMesh wasn’t born out of a whitepaper—it was forged in one of the most complex regulated industries in the world: cannabis finance.

Under a grant to build decentralized infrastructure for the cannabis sector, we didn’t start with theories—we started with regulators, custody, and compliance audits. The space demanded **verifiable identity, immutable logs, and real-time audits**—requirements that make most Web3 projects fold. But we saw an opportunity:

> If we could build programmable trust for cannabis, we could build it for any industry.

That’s where TrustMesh began: not as a social network, but as a compliance-first infrastructure for authentic, sovereign digital trust.

Now, under the pressure and visibility of the Hedera Hackathon, the broader architecture and civic potential of TrustMesh is coming into full view—transforming from a specialized compliance tool into a general-purpose framework for decentralized trust infrastructure.

## Using Hedera's Standards for Verifiable Trust

TrustMesh treats trust like a first-class primitive—finite, contextual, and programmable.

Every act of recognition, endorsement, or collaboration becomes an HCS event, immutably logged and signed. Where DeFi tracks value, **TrustMesh tracks trust**—anchoring social context, not just transactions.

```json
{
  "event_type": "recognition",
  "issuer": "0.0.12345",
  "subject": "0.0.67890",
  "signal_type": "Integrity",
  "context": { "circle_id": "uuid" },
  "signature": "ed25519sig"
}
```

These events aren’t opinions. They’re **audit-grade**, cryptographically signed trust statements—instantly queryable from Hedera mirror nodes or subgraphs.

## Standards in Action: Deployed Today

TrustMesh is powered entirely by Hedera-native HCS standards. No custom middleware. No walled gardens. Just composable, interoperable protocols:

| HCS Standard                  | Role in TrustMesh                            | Outcome                                         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **HCS-11 – Profile Metadata** | Defines portable identity and trust anchors  | Self-sovereign, app-independent reputation      |
| **HCS-5 – Hashinals**         | Anchors immutable trust signals              | Cross-platform recognition and proof            |
| **HCS-2 – Topic Registries**  | Categorizes signal types and domains         | Scalable trust circle taxonomy                  |
| **HCS-3 – Recursive Links**   | Trust nodes can reference others             | Enables nested, lineage-aware trust             |
| **HCS-8/9 – Poll Topics**     | Governance and civic coordination mechanisms | Trust-weighted voting and verifiable governance |

All acknowledgements, polls, and trust links in the demo ride on these open standards.

## From Hackathon to HCS-21: What’s Next

We’re proposing **HCS-21 – Decentralized Trust Signaling**, an extension designed to unify the schema and structure of social trust events.

| Proposed Standard            | Purpose                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HCS-21 – Trust Signaling** | Merges recognition, stake, and attestation events into a unified format |

HCS-21 will enable:

* Interoperable civic and social signals across dApps and networks
* Wallet-native trust recognition
* DAO governance extensions based on verifiable human context

**Next steps:**

* HCS-21 draft specification in progress
* SDK for developers to log/query trust signals
* Looking for integration partners in civic tech, campus orgs, and regulated sectors

## TrustMesh System Architecture

### Compliance as Code

Every trust signal is Ed25519-signed, timestamped, and publicly queryable. These aren’t likes or karma points—they’re compliance-grade attestations.

### Interoperability by Default

Built entirely on HCS-native standards, TrustMesh allows any compliant dApp, wallet SDK, or civic platform to read or extend the data.

### Inner Circle = Bounded Trust

Each user holds a finite number of trust tokens inside their **Inner Circle**. This introduces scarcity and intentionality into the network—making relationships measurable, portable, and resistant to spam or vanity metrics.

---

## Summary

Where the Guardian measures carbon, TrustMesh measures **character**.

What began as decentralized infrastructure for a highly-regulated market is now proving viable for civic networks, cooperatives, and coordination protocols at scale.

**TrustMesh demonstrates that programmable trust isn’t a theory—it’s live, verifiable, and standards-based.**
