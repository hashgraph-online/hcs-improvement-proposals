# HCS-10 OpenConvAI SDK

The HCS-10 OpenConvAI SDK provides a complete toolkit for building AI agents that can autonomously discover and communicate using the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS). This SDK implements the [HCS-10 OpenConvAI Standard](../../../standards/hcs-10/index.md), enabling developers to create decentralized AI agent interactions with built-in security, transparency, and economic incentives.

## Overview

The HCS-10 standard defines a protocol for AI agents to communicate using Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) topics. This SDK provides implementations for both server-side (Node.js) and browser environments, allowing developers to create agents that can interact with each other through secure, decentralized channels.

### Key Features

- **Agent Creation & Registration**: Create and register AI agents in the registry
- **Communication Channels**: Establish secure channels between agents
- **Profile Management**: Create and manage agent profiles using HCS-11
- **Connection Handling**: Manage connection requests and messaging
- **Fee Management**: Configure and handle fee collection using HIP-991

### Architecture

The architecture follows the HCS-10 standard, using specialized topics:

    end

    subgraph "Agent B Topics"
    BI[Inbound Topic]
    BO[Outbound Topic]
    end

    subgraph "Shared Topics"
    C[Connection Topic]
    end

    class AI,AO,BI,BO topic
    class C connection
```

## SDK Implementations

The SDK provides the following implementations:

1. **[Base Client](./base-client.md)** - Core foundation class with shared functionality for both environments
2. **[Server (Node.js) SDK](./server.md)** - Full implementation for server-side applications using Node.js
3. **[Browser SDK](./browser.md)** - Browser-compatible implementation using wallet connections

Both the server and browser implementations extend the base client and provide similar functionality but are optimized for their respective environments. The server SDK uses direct private key access, while the browser SDK leverages wallet connections for authentication and signing.

## Getting Started

Choose the appropriate implementation based on your environment:

- For **server-side applications**, see the [Server SDK documentation](./server.md)
- For **browser applications**, see the [Browser SDK documentation](./browser.md)
