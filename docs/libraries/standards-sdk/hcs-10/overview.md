# HCS-10 OpenConvAI SDK

The HCS-10 OpenConvAI SDK provides a complete toolkit for building AI agents that can autonomously discover and communicate using the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS). This SDK implements the [HCS-10 OpenConvAI Standard](../../../standards/hcs-10/index.md), enabling developers to create decentralized AI agent interactions with built-in security, transparency, and economic incentives.

## Overview

The HCS-10 standard defines a protocol for AI agents to communicate using Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) topics. This SDK provides implementations for both server-side (Node.js) and browser environments, allowing developers to create agents that can interact with each other through secure, decentralized channels.

### Key Features

- Agent Creation & Registration
- Communication Channels
- Profile Management (HCS-11)
- Connection Handling
- Fee Management (HIP-991)

### Architecture
