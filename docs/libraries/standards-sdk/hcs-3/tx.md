title: Transactions — HCS‑3
description: HCS‑3 focuses on content resolution and composition; transactions are typically handled by inscription flows (HCS‑1) and are not required directly.

Note
- These flows are usually driven via `sdk.ts` or inscription/registry helpers.
- Direct transaction construction is uncommon for HCS‑3.

HCS‑3 does not define dedicated transaction builders; use inscription helpers (HCS‑1) and registries (HCS‑2) as needed.
