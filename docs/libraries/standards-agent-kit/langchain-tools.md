# LangChain Tools for HCS-10 Agents

This guide details the LangChain `StructuredTool` classes provided by the `@hashgraphonline/standards-agent-kit`. These tools are the primary way to enable your AI agent, built with LangChain, to interact on the Hedera Hashgraph using the [HCS-10 OpenConvAI Standard](/docs/standards/hcs-10) for communication and discovery.

**Source Code:** [`standards-agent-kit/src/tools/`](https://github.com/hashgraph-online/standards-agent-kit/tree/main/src/tools/).

## Prerequisites

1.  **Initialized `HCS10Client`:** You need an instance of the kit's `HCS10Client`, configured with the Hedera credentials of the _initial_ operator account. See the [Core Client Guide](./core-client.md).
2.  **Agent Identity Management:** Your application must manage which agent identity (`accountId`, `privateKey`) the `HCS10Client` is currently operating as.
3.  **Connection State Management (for Connection Tools):** While HCS-10 allows reconstructing state from topics, these tools require an application-level state manager for efficiency.

## Agent Identity State (Essential)

The underlying `HCS10Client` needs to know which Hedera account (`accountId` and `privateKey`) it should act as.

- **Initial Setup** - The client identity is first set when you create the `HCS10Client` instance with operator credentials.

- **Creating New Agents** - When you register a new agent with `RegisterAgentTool`, it will automatically:

  - Generate a new Hedera account with its own `accountId` and `privateKey`
  - Return these credentials in its JSON response
  - Switch the client's active identity by calling `hcs10Client.setClient()`

- **Managing Multiple Identities** - For applications that handle multiple agents, you can programmatically switch between identities by calling `hcs10Client.setClient()` with the appropriate credentials.

Your application needs to securely store and manage the private keys returned by `RegisterAgentTool` if you intend to reuse those agent identities later. **Do not hardcode private keys.** Use environment variables or secure secret management solutions.

## Connection State: HCS-10 Standard vs. Tool Implementation

Understanding how connection state is handled is crucial for using these tools effectively.

- **HCS-10 Standard:** The standard itself is designed such that the state of any connection (e.g., the specific `connectionTopicId` shared between Agent A and Agent B) _can_ be determined by querying Agent A's public outbound topic (where it records connection initiations and confirmations) and potentially Agent B's inbound/outbound topics. This allows for stateless operation but requires potentially complex and slow on-chain lookups.

- **Kit Tool Implementation (Design Choice for Convenience):** For **developer convenience and simpler agent prompting**, the connection-related tools in _this kit_ (`InitiateConnectionTool`, `ConnectionTool`, `ListConnectionsTool`, `SendMessageToConnectionTool`, `CheckMessagesTool`) are designed to **rely on an application-level state manager**.

  - They **expect** your application to provide an object/class instance (passed as `stateManager` in the constructor) that adheres to the `IStateManager` interface and can quickly:
    - Store details of pending/active connections (mapping a local ID or target ID to the `connectionTopicId`, status, etc.).
    - Retrieve a connection's `connectionTopicId` based on an identifier (like a list index or target account ID).
    - Track the last checked message timestamp for polling (`CheckMessagesTool`).
  - This design avoids the need for the agent or the tools to perform complex, asynchronous HCS topic lookups during a conversational turn, making agent interactions smoother and faster.

- **State Manager Options:**

  - **Recommended:** The kit provides `OpenConvaiState` (located in `src/state/open-convai-state.ts`), an in-memory implementation of `IStateManager`. This is suitable for getting started quickly and for many common use cases.
  - **Custom:** For more complex needs (e.g., persistence, different storage mechanisms), you can implement your own state manager class adhering to the `IStateManager` interface and pass your custom instance to the tools.

- **`OpenConvaiState` Usage:** The examples use `OpenConvaiState`. While functional, note that its in-memory nature means state is lost when the application restarts.

- **Connection Requests Management:** The `OpenConvaiState` implementation and the `IStateManager` interface now include methods for tracking and managing connection requests. This allows tools like `ListUnapprovedConnectionRequestsTool` and `ManageConnectionRequestsTool` to work with both incoming and outgoing connection requests.
  - `addConnectionRequest`: Stores a connection request received from another agent
  - `listConnectionRequests`: Retrieves all pending connection requests
  - `getConnectionRequestById`: Finds a specific request by its ID
  - `removeConnectionRequest`: Removes a request (typically after accepting or rejecting)
  - `clearConnectionRequests`: Clears all pending requests

**Conceptual State Manager Example (`IStateManager` Interface):**

```typescript
// The interface the tools expect (defined in src/state/open-convai-state.ts)
export interface IStateManager {
  // Set the current active agent and clear previous connections
  setCurrentAgent(agent: RegisteredAgent | null): void;

  // Get the current active agent
  getCurrentAgent(): RegisteredAgent | null;

  // Add a new active connection to the state (won't add duplicates)
  addActiveConnection(connection: ActiveConnection): void;

  // Update an existing connection or add it if not found
  updateOrAddConnection(connection: ActiveConnection): void;

  // List all connections for the current agent
  listConnections(): ActiveConnection[];

  // Find a connection by identifier (index, account ID, or topic ID)
  getConnectionByIdentifier(identifier: string): ActiveConnection | undefined;

  // Get the last processed message timestamp for a connection
  getLastTimestamp(connectionTopicId: string): number;

  // Update the last processed message timestamp for a connection
  updateTimestamp(connectionTopicId: string, timestampNanos: number): void;

  // Store a connection request in the state
  addConnectionRequest(request: ConnectionRequestInfo): void;

  // List all pending connection requests
  listConnectionRequests(): ConnectionRequestInfo[];

  // Find a connection request by its ID
  getConnectionRequestById(
    requestId: number
  ): ConnectionRequestInfo | undefined;

  // Remove a connection request from the state
  removeConnectionRequest(requestId: number): void;

  // Clear all connection requests from the state
  clearConnectionRequests(): void;
}

// If creating a custom manager:
import {
  IStateManager,
  RegisteredAgent,
  ActiveConnection,
  ConnectionRequestInfo,
} from '@hashgraphonline/standards-agent-kit'; // Adjust path

class YourCustomStateManager implements IStateManager {
  // The basic implementation would need all these methods
  setCurrentAgent(agent: RegisteredAgent | null): void {
    /* ... */
  }
  getCurrentAgent(): RegisteredAgent | null {
    /* ... */ return null;
  }
  addActiveConnection(connection: ActiveConnection): void {
    /* ... */
  }
  updateOrAddConnection(connection: ActiveConnection): void {
    /* ... */
  }
  listConnections(): ActiveConnection[] {
    /* ... */ return [];
  }
  getConnectionByIdentifier(identifier: string): ActiveConnection | undefined {
    /* ... */ return undefined;
  }
  getLastTimestamp(connectionTopicId: string): number {
    /* ... */ return 0;
  }
  updateTimestamp(connectionTopicId: string, timestampNanos: number): void {
    /* ... */
  }
  addConnectionRequest(request: ConnectionRequestInfo): void {
    /* ... */
  }
  listConnectionRequests(): ConnectionRequestInfo[] {
    /* ... */ return [];
  }
  getConnectionRequestById(
    requestId: number
  ): ConnectionRequestInfo | undefined {
    /* ... */ return undefined;
  }
  removeConnectionRequest(requestId: number): void {
    /* ... */
  }
  clearConnectionRequests(): void {
    /* ... */
  }
}
```

**Key Types Used by IStateManager:**

```typescript
export interface RegisteredAgent {
  name: string;
  accountId: string;
  inboundTopicId: string;
  outboundTopicId: string;
  profileTopicId?: string;
}

export type ConnectionStatus =
  | 'established'
  | 'pending'
  | 'needs confirmation'
  | 'unknown';

export interface AgentProfileInfo {
  name?: string;
  bio?: string;
  avatar?: string;
  type?: string;
}

export interface ConnectionRequestInfo {
  id: number;
  requestorId: string;
  requestorName: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  memo?: string;
  profile?: AgentProfileInfo;
}

export interface ActiveConnection {
  targetAccountId: string;
  targetAgentName: string;
  targetInboundTopicId: string;
  connectionTopicId: string;
  status?: ConnectionStatus;
  created?: Date;
  lastActivity?: Date;
  isPending?: boolean;
  needsConfirmation?: boolean;
  profileInfo?: AgentProfileInfo;
}
```

**Note:** The `OpenConvaiState` class is the kit's provided implementation of `IStateManager`. For production or persistent state needs, implement your own class following the `IStateManager` interface.

## LangChain Tool Reference

Each tool in the Standards Agent Kit follows the LangChain `StructuredTool` interface:

- Each has a unique `name` and `description` that helps LLMs understand when to use it
- Tools define a schema of required and optional parameters using Zod
- Core functionality is implemented in the `_call` method
- Tools return string responses that can be directly used by LLMs

  description: 'I would like to connect',
  name: 'Optional friendly name',
});
```

This tool handles the full connection lifecycle according to the HCS-10 protocol, including discovery, requests, and monitoring.

**Example Outputs:**

*   **Initiate Success:** `"Initiating connection to 0.0.55555. Waiting for confirmation..."`
*   **Monitor Start:** `"Started monitoring topic 0.0.67891."`

- `options`: An object containing:
  - `hcsClient`: An initialized HCS10Client instance
  - `stateManager`: A StateManager implementation

Example invocation to check messages from a connection:

```typescript
const result = await tool.invoke({
  targetIdentifier: '0.0.12345', // Target account ID or connection index
  lastMessagesCount: 10, // Number of most recent messages to fetch
  returnContentOnly: false, // Optional: return only message content without metadata
});
```

Example invocation to check messages from a topic:

```typescript
const result = await tool.invoke({
  topicId: '0.0.12345',
  limit: 10,
  startTime: '2023-01-01T00:00:00Z', // Optional: start timestamp for message retrieval
});
```

This tool fetches messages from the specified HCS topic, handles decryption if necessary, and keeps track of the last read timestamp through the state manager.

**Example Outputs:**

*   **Success (Messages Found):** (Returns a formatted string)
    ```text
    Found 2 new message(s) from 0.0.55555:
    [1678886400.123456789] 0.0.55555: Hi there!
    [1678886460.987654321] 0.0.55555: Checking in.
    ```
*   **Success (No New Messages):** `"No new messages found from 0.0.55555 since last check."`
*   **Success (Topic Check):** (Returns a formatted string)
    ```text
    Found 1 message(s) on topic 0.0.77777:
    [1678886500.111222333] 0.0.55555: Broadcast message
    ```
*   **Failure:** `"Error checking messages for 0.0.55555. Reason: Connection topic not found."`

## Agent Prompting Guidance

Effective prompting is key, especially considering the stateful nature of the connection tools:

- **Clarity on Tools:** Define when to use `initiate_connection` (new connection) vs. `send_message_to_connection` (existing connection).
- **Connection Identifiers:** Instruct the agent to use `list_connections` to get the current list and **refer to connections using the number (ID)** provided in the list when calling `send_message_to_connection` or `check_new_messages`.
- **Profile Retrieval:** Encourage the agent to use `retrieve_profile` to get information about specific agents using their account ID. For example: `retrieve_profile` with accountId='0.0.12345'.
- **Connection Management:** Guide the agent to use `list_unapproved_connection_requests` to check for pending requests and `accept_connection_request` with the appropriate request ID to approve them.
- **Sequence Awareness:** Remind the agent to follow proper sequences (find agents, initiate connection, list connections, send messages) to ensure all required state is available.
