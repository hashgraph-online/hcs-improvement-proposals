## Abstract

**HCS-17** defines a standardized methodology for calculating cryptographic state hashes of Hiero accounts and multi-party formations ([HCS-16](/docs/standards/hcs-16) Floras). State hashes provide a tamper-evident, deterministic fingerprint of an account's current state by aggregating:

- HCS topic running hashes
- Account public keys
- Composite member states (for Floras/Blooms)

### Key Features

1. **Deterministic Calculation** – Same inputs always produce the same hash
2. **Quantum-Resistant** – Uses SHA-384 for future-proof security
3. **Recursive Composition** – Floras aggregate Petal states, Blooms aggregate Flora states
4. **Efficient Verification** – O(log N) recalculation when single member changes state

### What This Standard Defines

- State hash calculation methodology for individual accounts
- Composite state hash algorithm for Floras and Blooms
- Threshold key fingerprint generation for multisig accounts
- Topic memo format and message protocol for state publications
- Integration patterns with HCS-15, HCS-16, and other standards

---

## Motivation

### The Challenge

Decentralized formations of AI agents, autonomous accounts, and multi-party coordination require **verifiable state synchronization**:

- **Trust Verification** – Members need to verify others are reporting accurate state
- **Rapid Reconciliation** – Detecting state divergence quickly prevents coordination failures
- **Audit Trails** – Tamper-evident state history enables forensic analysis
- **Scalability** – Efficient state aggregation supports large formations (100+ members)

**Current Limitations**:
- No standardized method for calculating account state across Hiero ecosystem
- Ad-hoc state verification approaches lack interoperability
- Difficult to audit state changes across complex multi-party structures

### The HCS-17 Solution

HCS-17 solves these challenges through:

#### 1. Standardized State Calculation
Defines explicit algorithm for aggregating:
- HCS topic running hashes (tamper-proof consensus state)
- Account public keys (identity binding)
- Member account states (hierarchical composition)

#### 2. Quantum-Resistant Cryptography
Uses SHA-384 instead of SHA-256 for enhanced security against future quantum attacks.

#### 3. Hierarchical Composition
Enables efficient state aggregation across multi-level structures:
- **Petals** (individual accounts) compute base state
- **Floras** (multi-party groups) aggregate Petal states
- **Blooms** (federations) aggregate Flora states
- **Meadows** (future) aggregate Bloom states

#### 4. Efficient Verification
O(log N) recalculation time when single member changes state enables:
- Real-time state monitoring for large formations
- Minimal computational overhead
- Rapid detection of state divergence

## Specification

### State Hash Overview

HCS-17 defines a **deterministic cryptographic procedure** for computing a single hash value that represents the complete state of a Hiero account. This hash aggregates:

1. **Topic State** – Latest running hash from relevant HCS topics
2. **Identity** – Account ID and public key
3. **Member State** (Floras/Blooms) – State hashes of child accounts

**Core Principle**: Any two implementations observing the same on-chain data **MUST** compute identical state hashes.

**Hash Function**: SHA-384 (48 bytes output) for quantum resistance

---

### Individual Account State Hash

For individual accounts (Petals), the state hash aggregates the account's monitored HCS topics and identity.

#### Algorithm

**Step 1: Gather Topic Data**

Retrieve the latest running hash from each relevant HCS topic the account:
- Participates in (e.g., HCS-10 communication topics)
- Monitors (e.g., registry topics)
- Created (e.g., profile topics, outbound action logs)

**Step 2: Sort Topics**

Sort topic IDs numerically in **ascending order** (e.g., `0.0.123`, `0.0.456`, `0.0.789`)

**Step 3: Construct Concatenation String**

Build string with format:
```
topicId1_runningHash1|topicId2_runningHash2|...|accountId_publicKey
```

**Delimiters**:
- `_` (underscore) between topic ID and its running hash
- `|` (pipe) between each topic pair
- `|` (pipe) before account ID and public key

**Step 4: Apply SHA-384 Hash**

```
StateHash = SHA384(concatenatedString)
```

#### Formal Definition

```
StateHash = SHA384(
  topicId₁_runningHash₁|
  topicId₂_runningHash₂|
  ...|
  topicIdₙ_runningHashₙ|
  accountId_publicKey
)
```

Where:
- `topicId₁ < topicId₂ < ... < topicIdₙ` (numerically sorted)
- `runningHashᵢ` is the hex-encoded latest running hash for `topicIdᵢ`
- `publicKey` is the hex-encoded public key of the account

#### Example Calculation

**Given**:
- Topic ID: `0.0.12345` with running hash `abcd1234`
- Topic ID: `0.0.67890` with running hash `efgh5678`
- Account ID: `0.0.9988`
- Public Key: `FGHKLJHDGK`

**Step 1**: Sort topics → `0.0.12345`, `0.0.67890` (already sorted)

**Step 2**: Construct string:
```
0.0.12345_abcd1234|0.0.67890_efgh5678|0.0.9988_FGHKLJHDGK
```

**Step 3**: Apply SHA-384:
```javascript
StateHash = SHA384("0.0.12345_abcd1234|0.0.67890_efgh5678|0.0.9988_FGHKLJHDGK")
// Result: a3f5b8c2d1e7... (96 hex characters for 48 bytes)
```

#### When to Recalculate

You can choose to recalculate state hash when:
- ✅ Any monitored topic receives a new message (running hash changes) / or time interval 
- ✅ Account adds/removes topics from monitoring list
- ✅ Account updates its public key (rare, but possible via key rotation)
- ❌ **NOT** when account balance changes (balance is not included in state)
- ❌ **NOT** when off-chain state changes (only on-chain HCS state matters)

## Composite State Hash Calculation for Floras & Blooms

Floras and Blooms are composite Hedera accounts whose validity derives from the coordinated behaviour of a set of underlying member accounts (their Petals for Floras, and Floras/Petals for Blooms).

To provide a single, tamper‑evident view of the composite, HCS‑17 extends the base procedure so that a Flora or Bloom publishes a CompositeStateHash that is deterministically derived from:

- **Member account state**: The latest StateHash of every direct child account (Petal, Flora, etc).
- **Composite interaction topics**: The latest running hash of every HCS topic that was created by or for the composite (e.g., escrow, governance, and inter‑composite communication topics defined in HCS‑16).
- **Composite public‑key fingerprint**:: The deterministic fingerprint of the composite’s threshold key

The procedure MUST be applied recursively: a Bloom aggregates the CompositeStateHash values of the Floras it contains; a Flora aggregates the StateHash values of its Petals.

<!-- **TODO** Determine if smart contract addresses that were deployed by the account or composite should be includeded in the same manner as topic ids. -->

## Algorithm

1. Collect child hashes (utilize the state topic in Floras / Blooms for latest state postings)
   Retrieve StateHash_i for every direct child account accountId_i.
2. Collect composite topic hashes
   Retrieve the latest running hash runningHash_j for every topic topicId_j where the composite is adminKey / submitKey / where the programs state is important.
3. Sort & concatenate:

- Sort child accountId values lexicographically and concatenate accountId _ StateHash for each.
- Sort topicId lexicographically and concatenate topicId _ runningHash for each.
- Append the composite public‑key fingerprint from the threshold‑key procedure.

4. Hash in SHA384

```
CompositeStateHash =
    SHA384( Σ_sorted( accountId_StateHash) |
            Σ_sorted( topicId_runningHash_j ) |
            composite_publicKeyFingerprint )
```

Example (Flora with 2 Petals)

- Petal A – accountId 0.0.111 → StateHash 0xaaa
- Petal B – accountId 0.0.222 → StateHash 0xbbb
- Flora’s transaction topic – topicId 0.0.333 → runningHash 0xccc
- Flora’s communication topic – topicId 0.0.444 → runningHash 0xddd
- Flora account id – 0.0.777
- Flora public‑key fingerprint – 0xffff

Concatenate (IDs sorted):

```
0.0.111_0xaaa|0.0.222_0xbbb|0.0.333_0xccc|0.0.444_0xddd|0.0.777_0xffff
```

Apply SHA‑384:

```
CompositeStateHash = SHA384("0.0.111_0xaaa|0.0.222_0xbbb|0.0.333_0xccc|0.0.444_0xddd|0.0.777_0xffff")
```

Implementation Notes

- **Frequency** – Re‑compute after detecting any child StateHash or composite topic runningHash update, or at the synchronization interval specified by HCS‑16.
- **Bridging layers** – Applications SHOULD store the most recent CompositeStateHash in a HCS-2 topic with indexed:false. The newest hash state of the composite account will always be the latest message. The Flora / Bloom, can add the topic id for this state in it's metadata so other agents can verify composite integrity offline.
- **Versioning** – Future extensions (e.g., Meadow‑level aggregation) MUST follow the same recursive pattern, guaranteeing O(log N) recalculation time when a single leaf changes.

Implementation Workflow

1. Identify all relevant topics.
2. Regularly fetch the latest running hash for each topic.
3. Append the current public key of the account
4. Compute and broadcast the state hash periodically according to HCS-16’s synchronization interval.


## Deterministic, application-level public key for Keylist + Threshold Keys (Floras, Blooms, etc)

When calculating state for a Flora, Bloom, or any account that is comprised of a threshold of other keys for a valid signature, this method of public key fingerprint calculation should be utilized and replace public key in the state creation above.

1. Sort the N compressed ECDSA public keys lexicographoically (by their 33-byte SEC1).
   > **Note:** ED25519 keys should work as well, but they are not recomended unless neccessary.
2. Construct a Hedera ThresholdKey protobuf message with your threshold value and that sorted list
3. Serialize that message using Protobuf’s deterministic option to get a reproducible byte array

The result of these steps will give you a fingerprint of the threshold key account that functions as the public key of this account. This fingerprint is consistently calculatable and gives the unquiness of a public key for the account that can be utilized effectively for determining the state of the account.

## Security Considerations

- An auditing of state and truthfulness should be done periodically inside any coordinating group of accounts that are sharing state to ensure all accounts in the group are conveying their state correctly.

## Conclusion

HCS-17 provides a robust, transparent, and standardized methodology for calculating state hashes within decentralized AppNet clusters, enhancing reliability and facilitating scalable synchronization across Hedera-based AI ecosystems.

### Topic Memo Format

HCS-17 state hash topics support two memo format patterns depending on context:

#### Standalone State Hash Topics

For independent state hash topics (not part of an [HCS-16](/docs/standards/hcs-16) Flora):

**Format**: `hcs-17:<type>:<ttl>`

**Components**:
- `hcs-17` – Protocol identifier
- `<type>` – Numeric enum for topic type:
  - `0` → State Hash Topic (non-indexed)
- `<ttl>` – Time-to-live in seconds for retention guidance (e.g., `86400` for 24 hours)

**Example**:
```
hcs-17:0:86400  // Standalone state hash topic with 24h TTL
```

#### HCS-16 Flora State Topics (STopic)

For state topics within an [HCS-16](/docs/standards/hcs-16) Flora formation, the topic **SHOULD** use the HCS-16 memo format for consistency with other Flora topics:

**Format**: `hcs-16:<floraAccountId>:2`

**Components**:
- `hcs-16` – Protocol identifier (indicates Flora infrastructure)
- `<floraAccountId>` – The Flora account ID (e.g., `0.0.777`)
- `2` – Topic type enum for State Topic (STopic)

**Example**:
```
hcs-16:0.0.777:2  // State Topic for Flora 0.0.777
```

**Rationale**: Using HCS-16 memo format for Flora STopics:
- Maintains consistency with CTopic (`hcs-16:<floraId>:0`) and TTopic (`hcs-16:<floraId>:1`)
- Enables easy identification of all topics belonging to a Flora
- Simplifies indexing and discovery of Flora infrastructure
- Messages posted to this topic still use HCS-17 message protocol (see below)

**Alternative**: Floras **MAY** use `hcs-17:0:<ttl>` format if they prefer explicit HCS-17 identification, though `hcs-16:<floraId>:2` is recommended for consistency with other Flora topics.

---

### Message Protocol

All HCS-17 state hash publications use a standardized JSON message format, **regardless of whether the topic memo uses `hcs-17:*` or `hcs-16:*` format**.

#### State Hash Operation

**Message Shape**:

```json
{
  "p": "hcs-17",
  "op": "state_hash",
  "state_hash": "<hex-string>",
  "topics": ["0.0.topic1", "0.0.topic2"],
  "account_id": "0.0.123456",
  "epoch": 15,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T12:00:00.000Z",
  "m": "Optional memo"
}
```

**Fields**:

| Field        | Description                                                      | Type     | Required |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| `p`          | Protocol identifier, always `"hcs-17"`                           | string   | Yes      |
| `op`         | Operation type, always `"state_hash"`                            | string   | Yes      |
| `state_hash` | Hex-encoded SHA-384 state hash (96 characters)                   | string   | Yes      |
| `topics`     | Array of topic IDs included in state calculation                 | string[] | Yes      |
| `account_id` | Account ID whose state is being published                        | string   | Yes      |
| `epoch`      | Monotonically increasing counter for state transitions           | number   | No       |
| `timestamp`  | ISO-8601 timestamp of when state hash was calculated             | string   | No       |
| `m`          | Optional human-readable memo                                     | string   | No       |

**Transaction Memo** (when posting to topic):
- For standalone topics: No specific transaction memo required
- For [HCS-16](/docs/standards/hcs-16) Flora STopics: Use `hcs-16:op:2:2` (state_update operation on STopic)

**Usage Example**:

```json
{
  "p": "hcs-17",
  "op": "state_hash",
  "state_hash": "a3f5b8c2d1e74f9a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a",
  "topics": ["0.0.12345", "0.0.67890"],
  "account_id": "0.0.9988",
  "epoch": 42,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T14:32:15.123Z",
  "m": "State update after topic 0.0.67890 received new message"
}
```

**Integration with HCS-16**:

When posting to an [HCS-16](/docs/standards/hcs-16) Flora's STopic (memo: `hcs-16:<floraId>:2`), use the exact same HCS-17 message format above. The `account_id` field **SHOULD** be set to the Flora account ID for composite state hashes, or to the Petal account ID for member-specific state publications.

**Example for Flora Composite State**:

```json
{
  "p": "hcs-17",
  "op": "state_hash",
  "state_hash": "b4e6c9d2e1f8...",
  "topics": ["0.0.888", "0.0.889", "0.0.890"],
  "account_id": "0.0.777",
  "epoch": 13,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T14:35:00.000Z",
  "m": "Flora composite state after member join"
}
```

---

## Integration with Existing Standards

### HCS-16 Flora Integration

HCS-17 provides standardized state synchronization for [HCS-16](/docs/standards/hcs-16) Flora formations:

**Topic Memo Format**: Flora STopics use HCS-16 memo format (`hcs-16:<floraId>:2`) for consistency with other Flora topics

**Message Protocol**: All state publications to Flora STopics use HCS-17 message format (`"p": "hcs-17"`, `"op": "state_hash"`)

**State Calculation**:
- **Individual Petals**: Use individual account state hash algorithm
- **Flora Composite**: Use composite state hash algorithm aggregating all Petal states plus Flora topics

**Example Flora STopic Flow**:
```
1. Flora 0.0.777 is created with STopic 0.0.890 (memo: hcs-16:0.0.777:2)
2. Each Petal calculates individual state hash per HCS-17
3. Flora calculates composite state hash aggregating Petal hashes + Flora topic hashes
4. Flora publishes to STopic using HCS-17 message format
5. Members verify by independently recalculating composite hash
```

### HCS-15 Petal Integration

[HCS-15](/docs/standards/hcs-15) Petal accounts **SHOULD** publish state hashes to enable Flora composite state calculation:

**Recommended Pattern**:
1. Petal creates dedicated state topic (memo: `hcs-17:0:86400`)
2. Petal regularly publishes state hash updates
3. Petal includes state topic ID in [HCS-11](/docs/standards/hcs-11) profile
4. Flora members monitor Petal state topics for changes

### HCS-11 Profile Integration

State topic IDs **SHOULD** be included in [HCS-11](/docs/standards/hcs-11) profiles:

**Example Profile Addition**:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "type": 1,
  "topics": {
    "inbound": "0.0.123",
    "outbound": "0.0.124",
    "state": "0.0.125"  // HCS-17 state topic
  }
}
```

This enables:
- Automated discovery of state topics
- Verification of account state by third parties
- Integration with monitoring and analytics tools

---

## Implementation Workflow

### For Individual Accounts (Petals)

**Step 1: Identify Relevant Topics**

Determine which HCS topics to include in state calculation:
- Topics the account created (e.g., HCS-11 profile topic)
- Topics the account actively monitors (e.g., registry topics)
- Topics the account participates in (e.g., HCS-10 communication topics)

**Step 2: Create State Topic** (Optional)

If publishing state hashes regularly:
```typescript
const stateTopic = await new TopicCreateTransaction()
  .setTopicMemo("hcs-17:0:86400")  // 24h TTL
  .setSubmitKey(accountPublicKey)
  .execute(client);
```

**Step 3: Calculate State Hash**

```typescript
import { createHash } from 'crypto';

// Gather topic data
const topics = [
  { id: "0.0.123", runningHash: "abc123..." },
  { id: "0.0.456", runningHash: "def456..." }
].sort((a, b) => a.id.localeCompare(b.id));

// Build concatenation string
const parts = topics.map(t => `${t.id}_${t.runningHash}`);
parts.push(`${accountId}_${publicKey}`);
const concatString = parts.join('|');

// Calculate SHA-384 hash
const stateHash = createHash('sha384')
  .update(concatString)
  .digest('hex');
```

**Step 4: Publish State Hash**

```typescript
await new TopicMessageSubmitTransaction()
  .setTopicId(stateTopicId)
  .setMessage(JSON.stringify({
    p: "hcs-17",
    op: "state_hash",
    state_hash: stateHash,
    topics: topics.map(t => t.id),
    account_id: accountId.toString(),
    epoch: currentEpoch,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  }))
  .execute(client);
```

**Step 5: Update on Changes**

You may recalculate and publish when:
- Any monitored topic receives a new message
- Account adds/removes topics from monitoring list
- At regular intervals (e.g., every 60 seconds)

### For Flora Accounts (Composite)

**Step 1: Monitor Member State Topics**

Subscribe to each Petal's state topic to receive state updates:
```typescript
for (const member of floraMembers) {
  const stateTopicId = await getStateTopicFromProfile(member.accountId);
  subscribeToTopic(stateTopicId, handleMemberStateUpdate);
}
```

**Step 2: Calculate Composite State Hash**

```typescript
// Gather child state hashes (sorted lexicographically)
const memberStates = [
  { id: "0.0.111", hash: "0xaaa..." },
  { id: "0.0.222", hash: "0xbbb..." }
].sort((a, b) => a.id.localeCompare(b.id));

// Gather Flora topic hashes (sorted lexicographically)
const floraTopics = [
  { id: "0.0.333", hash: "0xccc..." },
  { id: "0.0.444", hash: "0xddd..." }
].sort((a, b) => a.id.localeCompare(b.id));

// Build concatenation string (no delimiters)
const memberParts = memberStates.map(m => `${m.id}_${m.hash}`);
const topicParts = floraTopics.map(t => `${t.id}_${t.hash}`);
const concatString = [...memberParts, ...topicParts, `${floraId}_${thresholdKeyFingerprint}`].join('|');

// Calculate composite hash
const compositeStateHash = createHash('sha384')
  .update(concatString)
  .digest('hex');
```

**Step 3: Publish to Flora STopic**

```typescript
await new TopicMessageSubmitTransaction()
  .setTopicId(floraStateTopicId)  // memo: hcs-16:0.0.777:2
  .setMessage(JSON.stringify({
    p: "hcs-17",
    op: "state_hash",
    state_hash: compositeStateHash,
    topics: floraTopics.map(t => t.id),
    account_id: floraId.toString(),
    epoch: floraEpoch,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  }))
  .setTransactionMemo("hcs-16:op:2:2")
  .execute(client);
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. State Hash Verification

**Risk**: Malicious accounts may publish incorrect state hashes to deceive others.

**Mitigations**:
- **Independent Verification**: Recipients SHOULD independently recalculate state hashes using publicly available topic data
- **Cross-Validation**: Compare published hashes against multiple sources
- **Threshold Verification**: In Floras, require majority of members to agree on composite state
- **Automated Monitoring**: Implement alerts for state hash discrepancies

**Best Practice**: Never trust state hashes blindly - always verify against on-chain HCS topic data when security is critical.

### 2. Topic Selection Attacks

**Risk**: Accounts may selectively include/exclude topics to manipulate perceived state.

**Mitigations**:
- **Document Topic List**: Clearly specify which topics are included in HCS-11 profile
- **Version Control**: Increment epoch when topic list changes
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain records of topic additions/removals
- **Policy Enforcement**: Flora policies SHOULD require consensus before changing monitored topics
