## Fields

### schema

**Tags:** required, case-insensitive

` "schema" : { "type" : "string" }`

The *schema* field defines the schema that is being used. It is any identifiable string about the standard or platform that the data follows. A developer who wishes to implement the schema will use the schema to filter data that they support and process it appropriately.

For the hcs-9 standard, the schema is defined as hcs-9-vote-rules.

### allocations

**Tags:** optional, module

Allocations is an array of modules that define how much weight each user receives for the poll. 

This specification implements a number of default allocation modules. This is covered more in detail on the [Vote Rules Implementation](../implementation/vote-rules-implementation.md) page.

**Default Behaviour** 

If allocations is not defined, every user receives 1 weight as the default behaviour.


### permissions

**Tags:** optional, module

Permissions is an array of modules that define who is allowed to perform the vote action.

Permissions are used for this purpose for every action. This specification implements a number of default permission modules. This is covered in more detail on the [Permissions](./permissions.md) page.

**Default Behaviour**

If permissions is not defined, all users are allowed to vote.

### rules

**Tags:** optional

Rules is an array of [rules](./rules.md) that define additional behaviours. 

This specification implements a number of default rules. This is covered more in detail on the [Vote Rules Implementation](../implementation/vote-rules-implementation.md) page.

**Default Behaviour**

If no rules are defined, all users are allowed take one vote action as the default behaviour.
