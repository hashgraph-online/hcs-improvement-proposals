# HCS-25 (Signal): x402 Usage (Informative)

## Purpose

Collect usage signals from onchain x402 payment activity and store an incremental cursor for scalable refresh.

## Applicability

Only applies when the subject has x402 payment configuration (e.g., includes protocol `x402` and has `payTo`, `asset`, and `network` metadata).

## Stored fields (example schema)

Stored in `subject.metadata`:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `x402UsageStatus` | `ok` \| `missing` \| `error` | Ingestion status |
| `x402UsageUpdatedAt` | ISO timestamp | Refresh time |
| `x402UsageSource` | string | Source identifier (e.g., `onchain`) |
| `x402UsageSummary` | object \| null | Aggregated usage values |
| `x402UsageCursor` | object \| null | Cursor/checkpoint for incremental backfill |

`x402UsageSummary`:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `volume7dUsd` | number | 7-day USD volume estimate |
| `volume24hUsd` | number | 24h USD volume estimate |
| `inboundTrades7d` | number | 7-day inbound trade count |
| `outboundTrades7d` | number | 7-day outbound trade count |
